This gem processes http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] documents and outputs
an XML representation of the document, intended as a document model for ISO
International Standards. The XML representation can then be processed in turn
to generate PDF or Microsoft Word output (via DocBook).

This AsciiDoc syntax for writing ISO standards is hereby named "AsciiISO".

The document model ("ISO XML") intends to introduce rigour into the ISO
standards authoring process; the existing 
https://www.iso.org/iso-templates.html[Microsoft Word template from ISO]
do not support such rigour down to the element level.

The ISO International Standard format is prescribed in
http://www.iec.ch/members_experts/refdocs/iec/isoiecdir-2%7Bed7.0%7Den.pdf[ISO/IEC DIR 2 "Principles and rules for the structure and drafting of ISO and IEC documents"],
to a level that is amenable to an explicit document model. A formal document
model would allow checking for consistency in format and content, and expedite
authoring and quality control of ISO standards.

The document model ("ISO XML") is under development, but it already contains
all the markup needed to render the
https://www.iso.org/publication/PUB100407.html["Rice document"], the ISO's
model document of an international standard, and all the structures described
in ISO/IEC DIR 2. It is expressed as a
link:lib/asciidoctor/iso/validate.rnc[Relax NG Compact schema]; actual
validation occurs against its link:lib/asciidoctor/iso/validate.rng[full Relax
NG counterpart]. A UML representation of the document model is given below.
Note that the document model is currently still in the exploratory phase, and
will likely be changing significantly.

Asciidoctor has been selected as the authoring tool to generate the document
model representation of ISO standards. It is a document formatting tool like
Markdown and DocBook, which combines the relative ease of use of the former
(using relatively lightweight markup), and the rigour and expressively of the
latter (it has a well-defined syntax, and was in fact initially developed as a
DocBook document authoring tool). Asciidoctor has built-in capability to output
Text, DocBook and HTML; so it can be used to preview the file as it is being
authored.

Note that in order to generate output close to what is intended, the Asciidoc
document includes a fair amount of formatting instructions (e.g. disabling
section numbering where appropriate, the titling of Appendixes as Annexes), as
well as ISO boilerplate text, and predefined section headers (sections are
recognised by fixed titles such as `Normative References`). Authoring ISO
standards in this fashion assumes that users will be populating an Asciidoc
template, and not removing needed formatting instructions.

== Features not visible in HTML preview

The gem uses built-in Asciidoc formatting as much as possible, so that users
can retain the ability to preview documents; for _Terms and Definitions_
clauses, which have a good deal of explicit structure, macros have been
introduced for semantic markup (admitted terms, deprecated terms, etc). The
default HTML output of an Asciidoc-formatted ISO document is quite close to the
intended final output, with the following exceptions: 

* _Terms and Definitions_: each term is marked up as an unnumbered subclause,
the semantic markup of alternate and other terms is not rendered visually.

* _Formulas_: Asciidoctor has no provision for the automated numbering of
isolated block formulas ("stem"), and does not display the number assigned a
block formula in its default HTML processorâ€”although it does provide automated
numbering of examples. The encoding of formulas may change in future versions,
although the final numbering is meant to be provided by downstream tools
processing the ISO XML output.

* _Missing elements_: The document model does not yet include Asciidoc elements
that do not occur in the Rice document: in particular, source code, definition
lists (except when used as keys for formulas or figures), examples (as distinct
from figures; examples within _Terms and Definitions_ are catered for),
sidebars (as distinct from warnings), quotes.

* _Markup_: Some connecting text which is used to convey markup structure is
left out: in particular, `DEPRECATED` and `SOURCE` (replaced by formatting
macros).

* _Tables_: Table footnotes are treated like all other footnotes: they are
rendered at the bottom of the document, rather than the bottom of the table,
and they are not numbered separately.

* _Cross-references_: Footnoted cross-references are indicated with the reference
text `fn` in isolation, or `fn:` as a prefix to the reference text. The default
HTML processor leaves these as is: if no reference text is given, only `fn`
will be displayed (though it will still hyperlink to the right reference).

* _References_: The convention for references is that ISO documents are cited
without brackets by ISO number, and optionally year, whether they are normative
or in the bibliography (e.g. `ISO 20483:2013`); while all other references are
cited by bracketed number in the bibliography (e.g. `[1]`). The default HTML
processor treats all references the same, and will bracket them (e.g. `[ISO
20483:2013]`). For the same reason, ISO references listed in the bibliography
will be listed under an ISO reference, rather than a bracketed number.

* _References_: References are rendered cited throughout, since they are
automated. For that reason, if reference is to be made to both an undated and a
dated version of an ISO reference, these need to be explicitly listed as
separate references. (This is not done in the Rice model document, which lists
ISO 6646, but under _Terms and Definitions_ cites the dated ISO 6646:2011.

* _References_: ISO references that are undated but published have their date
indicated under the ISO standards format in an explanatory footnote. Because of
constraints introduced by Asciidoctor, that explanation is instead given in
square brackets in Asciidoc format.

* _Annexes_: Subheadings cannot preserve subsection numbering, while also
appearing inline with their text (e.g. Rice document, Annex B.2): they appear
as headings in separate lines.

* _Annexes_: Cross-references to Annex subclauses are automatically prefixed
with `Clause` rather than `Annex` or nothing.

* _Metadata_: Document metadata such as document numbers, technical committees
and title wording are not rendered in the default HTML output.

* _Patent Notice_: Patent notices are treated and rendered as a subsection of
the introduction, with an explicit subheading.

* _Numbering_: The numbering of figures and tables is sequential in the default
HTML processor: it does not include the Clause or Annex number. This,
_Figure 1_, not _Figure A.1_.

* _Notes_: There is no automatic note numbering by the default HTML processor.

* _Keys_: Keys to formulas and figures are expected to be marked up as
definition lists consistently, rather than as inline prose.

* _Figures_: Simple figures are marked up as images, figures containing
subfigures as examples. Numbering by the default HTML processor may be
inconsistent. Subfigures are automatically numbered as independent figures.

* _Markup_: The default HTML processor does not support CSS extensions such as
small caps or strike through, though these can be marked up as CSS classes
through custom macros in Asciidoctor: a custom CSS stylesheet will be needed to
render them.



TODO: May need to only encode figures as examples.

== Document Attributes

The gem also relies on Asciidoctor document attributes to provide necessary
metadata about the document. These include:

`:docnumber:`:: The ISO document number (mandatory)

`:tc-docnumber:`:: The document number assigned by the Technical committee

`:partnumber:`:: The ISO document part number

`:edition:`:: The document edition

`:revdate:`:: The date the document was last updated

`:copyright-year:`:: The year which will be claimed as when the copyright for
the document was issued

`:title-intro-en:`:: The introductory component of the English title of the
document

`:title-main-en:`:: The main component of the English title of the document
(mandatory). (The first line of the AsciiDoc document, which contains the title
introduced with `=`, is ignored)

`:title-part-en:`:: The English title of the document part

`:title-intro-fr:`:: The introductory component of the French title of the
document. (This document template presupposes authoring in English; a different
template will be needed for French, including French titles of document
components such as annexes.)

`:title-main-fr:`:: The main component of the French title of the document
(mandatory). 

`:title-part-fr:`:: The French title of the document part

`:doctype:`:: The document type (see
https://www.iso.org/deliverables-all.html[ISO deliverables: The different types of ISO publications]
) (mandatory). The permitted types are:
`international-standard, technical-specification, technical-report,
publicly-available-specification, international-workshop-agreement, guide`.

`:docstage:`:: The stage code for the document status (see
https://www.iso.org/stage-codes.html[International harmonized stage codes])

`:docsubstage:`:: The substage code for the document status (see
https://www.iso.org/stage-codes.html[International harmonized stage codes])

`:secretariat:`:: The national body acting as the secretariat for the document
in the deafting stage

`:technical-committee-number:`:: The number of the relevant ISO technical
committee

`:technical-committee:`:: The name of the relevant ISO technical committee
(mandatory)

`:subcommittee-number:`:: The number of the relevant ISO subcommittee

`:subcommittee:`:: The name of the relevant ISO subcommittee

`:workgroup-number:`:: The number of the relevant ISO workgroup

`:workgroup:`:: The name of the relevant ISO workgroup

`:language:` :: The language of the document (`en` or `fr`)  (mandatory)


The attribute `:draft:`, if present, includes review notes in the XML output;
these are otherwise suppressed.


== Usage

[source,console]
----
$ asciidoctor a.adoc  # HTML output of Asciidoc file
$ asciidoctor -b iso -r 'asciidoctor-iso' a.adoc  # ISO XML output
----

The gem translates the document into ISO XML format, and then validates its
output against the ISO XML document model; errors are reported to console
against the XML, and are intended for users to check that they have provided
all necessary components of the document. The gem also realises several format
checks as prescribed in ISO/IEC DIR 2, and warns the user about them in the
console:

* Numbers with what looks like dots instead of commas for decimal points.

* Groups of numbers without spacing for every three digits. (The gem attempts
to ignore ISO references.)

* No space before percent sign.

* No bracketing of tolerance in percentage (e.g. `15 Â± 7 % .`)

* No recommendations, permissions or requirements (detected by keyword) in:
foreword, scope, introduction, term examples and examples, notes, footnotes.

* No subclauses that are the only child of a clause. (In clauses, annexes, or
scopes.)

* 5 levels of subclause nesting. (Never actuated, AsciiDoc only permits 4
levels of subsections.)

* Non-ISO/IEC reference turning up as normative.

* Term definition starts with an article, or ends with a period.

* Title intro or title part appears in only one of French or English.
