.Foreword 
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are described in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular the different approval criteria needed for the different types of ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the editorial rules of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 (see www.iso.org/directives).

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. Details of any patent rights identified during the development of the document will be in the Introduction and/or on the ISO list of patent declarations received (see www.iso.org/patents).

Any trade name used in this document is information given for the convenience of users and does not constitute an endorsement.

== Introduction 

This document was developed in response to worldwide demand for minimum specifications for rice traded internationally, since most commercial bulks of grain, which have not been screened or aspirated, contain a proportion of other grains, weed seeds, chaff, straw, stones, sand, etc. The vegetable materials can have physical and biological properties which differ from those of the main constituent and can therefore affect the storage behaviour. 

Rice is a permanent host to a considerable microflora; most of these microorganisms are cosmopolitan, the majority are innocuous, but some produce harmful by-products. Microflora communities present on freshly harvested rice include many types of bacteria, moulds and yeasts. While the rice is ripening and its moisture content is falling, the number of field microorganisms, mainly bacteria, diminishes. When the rice is harvested, it is invaded by storage microorganisms and the field microflora gradually dies out. If the mass fraction of moisture (formerly expressed as moisture content) is less than 18 %, the microflora does not multiply, whereas above 18 % it does so rapidly. Thus, at harvest, the qualitative and the quantitative composition of the microflora depends more upon ecological factors than upon the variety of the rice. During transport and storage, additions to the microfloral population occur. Microorganisms on the rice at harvest tend to die out during storage and are replaced by microorganisms adapted to storage conditions. 

Storage losses have been estimated as being an average of 5 %, and as much as 30 %, especially in countries with climates favourable to the rapid development of agents of deterioration and where storage techniques are poorly developed, such as developing countries in the damp tropics. The magnitude of these figures highlights the need to promote throughout the world a rapid improvement in techniques of conservation.

[appendix]
== Determination of defects (normative)

// "normative" follows title
=== Principle 

Extraneous matter, broken kernels, damaged kernels and other kinds of rice are separated manually according to the following types: husked rice, milled rice, husked parboiled rice and milled parboiled rice. Each type is then weighed. 

=== Apparatus 

The usual laboratory apparatus and, in particular, the following. 

// inline
[[AnnexA-2-1]]
==== Sample divider, 

consisting of a conical sample divider or multiple-slot sample divider with a distribution system, e.g. Split-it-right sample divider, such as that shown in <<figureA.1>>. 

==== Sieve, 

with round perforations of diameter 1,4 mm. 

==== Tweezers. 

==== Scalpel. 

==== Paintbrush. 

[[AnnexA-2-6]]
==== Steel bowls, 

of diameter 100 mm ± 5 mm; seven per test sample. 

==== Balance, 

which can be read to the nearest 0,01 g. 

=== Sampling 

See <<clause5>>. 

=== Procedure 

[[AnnexA-4-1]]
==== Preparation of test sample 

Carefully mix the laboratory sample to make it as uniform as possible, then proceed to reduce it, using a divider <<AnnexA-2-1>>, until a quantity of about 30 g is obtained. 

All parts of kernels which get stuck in the perforations of a sieve should be considered to be retained by the sieve. 

[[figureA-1]]
.Split-it-right sample divider
====
image::splititright.gif
====

=== Determination 

Weigh, to the nearest 0,1 g, one of the test samples obtained in accordance with <<AnnexA-4-1>> and separate the different defects into the bowls <<AnnexA-2-6>>. When a kernel has several defects, classify it in the defect category for which the maximum permissible value is the lowest (see Table 1). 

Weigh, to the nearest 0,01 g, the fractions so obtained. 

=== Calculation 

Express the mass fraction of each defect using Formula (<<formulaA-1>>): 

[[formulaA-1]]
[stem]
++++
w = m_D/m_s 
++++

where 

stem:[w]:: is the mass fraction of grains with a particular defect in the test sample; 
stem:[m_D]:: is the mass, in grams, of grains with that defect; 
stem:[m_S] is the mass, in grams, of the test sample. 

=== Test report 

Report the results as specified in <<clause7>>. 

[[AnnexB]]
[appendix]
== Determination of the waxy rice content of parboiled rice (informative)

=== Principle 

Waxy rice kernels have a reddish brown colour when stained in an iodine solution, while non-waxy rice kernels show a dark blue colour. 

=== Apparatus 

The usual laboratory apparatus and, in particular, the following. 

[[AnnexB-2-1]]
==== Balance, 

capable of weighing to the nearest 0,01 g. 

[[AnnexB-2-2]]
==== Glass beaker, 

of capacity 250 ml. 

[[AnnexB-2-3]]
==== Small white colour bowls, 

or any white colour container of a suitable size.

[[AnnexB-2-4]]
==== Wire sieve, 

with long rounded apertures of (1 mm stem:[{:(+0.02),(0):}] mm) &times; (20 mm stem:[{:(+2),(-1):}] mm). 

[[AnnexB-2-5]]
==== Stirrer rod. 

[[AnnexB-2-6]]
==== Tweezers or forceps. 

[[AnnexB-2-7]]
==== Tissue paper. 

===  Reagents 

WARNING: Direct contact of iodine with skin can cause lesions so care should be taken in handling iodine. Iodine vapour is very irritating to eyes and mucous membranes. 

[[AnnexB-3-1]]
==== Deionized water, 

Grade 3 quality as specified in ISO 3696.

[[AnnexB-3-2]]
==== Iodine stock solution, 

containing a mass fraction of 4,1 % iodine and 6,3 % potassium iodide in deionized water such as Lugols.footnote:[Lugols is an example of a suitable product available commercially. This information is given for the convenience of users of this document and does not constitute an endorsement by ISO of this product.] 

[[AnnexB-3-3]]
==== Iodine working solution, 

obtained by diluting the stock solution (<<AnnexB-3-2>>) two times (by volume) with deionized water (<<AnnexB-3-1>>). 

Prepare fresh daily. 

=== Sampling 

Sampling shall be carried out in accordance with <<clause5>>. 

=== Determination 

==== {blank}
Weigh a portion of about 100 g of milled rice and put it into a glass beaker (<<AnnexB-2-2>>). 

==== {blank}
Add enough iodine working solution (<<AnnexB-3-3>>) to soak the kernels, and stir (<<AnnexB-2-5>>) until all the kernels are submerged under the solution. Let the kernels soak in the solution for 30 s. 

==== {blank}
Pour the rice and solution into a wire sieve (<<AnnexB-2-4>>), and shake the basket slightly in order to drain out the solution. Then place the wire sieve on a piece of tissue paper (<<AnnexB-2-7>>) to absorb the excess liquid. 

==== {blank}
Pour the stained kernels into a bowl (<<AnnexB-2-3>>). Using tweezers or forceps (<<AnnexB-2-6>>), separate the reddish brown kernels of waxy rice from the dark blue kernels of non-waxy rice. 

==== {blank}
Weigh the waxy rice portion (stem:[m_1]) and the non-waxy rice portion (stem:[m_2]) to the nearest 0,1 g. 

=== Calculation 

Calculate the mass fraction, expressed as a percentage, of the waxy rice, stem:[w_(wax)], using Formula (<<formulaB.1>>): 

// Indexing formulas
[[formulaB-1]]
[stem]
++++
w_(wax) = m_1/(m_1 + m_2) xx 100
++++

where 

stem:[m_1]:: is the mass, expressed in grams, of the waxy rice portion; 
stem:[m_2]:: is the mass, expressed in grams, of the non-waxy rice portion. 

=== Test report 

Report the results as specified in <<clause7>>, giving the results calculated using Formula (<<formulaB-1>>).
